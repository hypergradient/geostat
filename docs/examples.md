# Examples

  * [An introduction to Geostat.](notebooks/gaussian-processes-in-geostat.ipynb)
  In Geostat, we create one model that is used to create synthetic data according
  to provided parameters, and we create a second model that does the inverse:
  it takes the data and infers the parameters.
  * [Structured covariance functions.](notebooks/3d-gaussian-processes.ipynb) Here
  we show how a progressively more complex covariance function fits data better
  than simpler ones.
  * [Making predictions in a shape.](notebooks/predictions-with-mesh.ipynb) Geostat
  has utility functions to make it easier to work with shapes.
  * [Gaussian processes in Tensorflow.](notebooks/gaussian-processes-in-tensorflow.ipynb) A tutorial on how to implement Gaussian processes in Tensorflow.
