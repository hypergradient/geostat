## [An introduction to Geostat](notebooks/gaussian-processes-in-geostat/gaussian-processes-in-geostat.md)

In Geostat, we create one model that is used to create synthetic data according
to provided parameters, and we create a second model that does the inverse:
it takes the data and infers the parameters.

## [Structured covariance functions](notebooks/3d-gaussian-processes/3d-gaussian-processes.md)

Here we show how a progressively more complex covariance function fits data better than simpler ones.

## [Making predictions in a shape](notebooks/predictions-with-mesh/predictions-with-mesh.md)

Geostat has utility functions to make it easier to work with shapes.

## [Gaussian processes in Tensorflow](notebooks/gaussian-processes-in-tensorflow/gaussian-processes-in-tensorflow.md)

A tutorial on how to implement Gaussian processes in Tensorflow.
